# openaddress-vt
binary vector tiles generated from openaddress

my codes are unlicensed. you may need to see the license of openaddress data, too.

## how to use
just download this repository and:
```sh
$ export MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN='pk.eyJ1IjoiaGZ1IiwiYSI6ImlRSGJVUTAifQ.rTx380smyvPc1gUfZv1cmw' # use your key
$ mbview openaddress-vt.mbtiles
```

enjoy!

## why did I made this?
just for fun and practice. But I also feel that binary vector tiles is a great way to disseminate the data, too.
